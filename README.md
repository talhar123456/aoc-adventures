# Advent of Code Solutions

## About This Repository

Welcome to my Advent of Code solutions repository! ðŸŽ‰

This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code problems. Advent of Code is an annual event featuring a series of programming puzzles designed to be fun and challenging. Each day, a new puzzle is released, and the goal is to solve these puzzles using programming and logic skills.

## Repository Goals

- **Problem Solving:** Showcase solutions to Advent of Code puzzles from recent years.
- **Logic Building:** Demonstrate problem-solving skills through various programming challenges.
- **Continuous Improvement:** Aim to solve puzzles from all available years, starting with the most recent.

## Contents

- **`dayXX.py`**: Python scripts for each day's puzzle (where `XX` is the day of the month).
- **`dayXX.txt`**: Input data files for each day's puzzle.
- **`README.md`**: This file, providing an overview of the repository.
